Create a MVC project called as2 using individual credential, https under the instruction of Professor
Steele.
Test the project. It is succefully built as expected.
Go to https://bootswatch.com/, navigate to darkly, click  'download' to download the source file.
But i tried this differently by click the picture of darkley, go to github copy the source code, and then
copy it to wwwroot/lib/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css, save it. ()
open blackboard, locate ASP.NET course content, download the css file and copy the source code to 
wwwroot/css/site.css (before copy to it, all original code was deleted).
